Question 1: Implement a C++ function named reverseString that takes a C-style string as a parameter and performs the following tasks:
1)    Determine the length of the input string without using any standard library functions.
2)    Create a new dynamically allocated character array to store the reverse of the input string.
3)    Reverse the characters of the input string and store the result in the dynamically allocated array.
4)   Print both the original and reversed strings.
Use the function in the main program with an example string like "practice" and print the results.

SOLUTION 1: 
void reverseString(char ptr[])
{
	cout << "Your input string is " << ptr << endl;
	cout << "The length of the string is ";
	int length = 0;
	while(ptr[length] != '\0'){
		length++;
	}
	cout << length << endl;
	
	char reverse[length +1];
	for(int len=0; len<length; len++ )
	{
		int index = length-1-len;
		reverse[len] = ptr[index];
	}
	cout << "the original string is " << ptr << endl;
	cout << "The reverse string is " << reverse << endl;
}
int main(){
	char arry[] = { 'P', 'R', 'A', 'C', 'T', 'I', 'C', 'E', '\0'};
	reverseString(arry);
	return 0;
}



Question 2: Implement a C++ function named memoryAddresses that takes two variables of different data types as parameters and performs the following tasks:
1)    Determine and print the memory address of the first variable without using any standard library functions.
2)    Determine and print the memory address of the second variable without using any standard library functions.
3)    Use the function in the main program with example variables and print the results.

SOLUTION 2:
#include "iostream"
using namespace std;

// The const keyword in C++ is used to indicate that a particular variable or object is constant, 
// meaning its value cannot be modified after initialization. 
// It is a type qualifier that can be applied to variables, pointers, references, member functions, and more.

void memoryAddress(const int& x, const char& y)
{
	cout << "The memory address of 1st variable " << &x << endl;
  	cout << "The memory address of 2st variable " <<static_cast<const void*>(&y) << endl;

// If you omit static_cast<const void*>, you might see a compilation error or unexpected behavior 
// because the << operator might interpret the char* as a C-style string and try to print characters until it finds a null terminator. 
// This is not what you want when printing memory addresses.	
	
}

main()
{
	int i = 10;
	char k = 'H';
	memoryAddress(i, k);
}



QUESTION 3: Implement a C++ function named dynamicMemoryAllocation that takes a variable of any data type as a parameter and performs the following tasks:\
1)    Dynamically allocate memory for the variable.
2)    Assign a value to the dynamically allocated variable.
3)    Print the value and memory address of the dynamically allocated variable.
4)    Deallocate the dynamically allocated memory.
Use the function in the main program with an example variable and print the results.

SOLUTION 3 :

#include "iostream"
#include "typeinfo"
using namespace std;

template <typename P>
void dynamicMemoryAllocat(P value)
{
	P *ptr = new P;  // intialize null pointer & then memory is requested to the variable 
	*ptr = value;    // dynamically assign value to dynamic variable 
	cout << "The value you enter is " << *ptr << endl;
	if(typeid(value) == typeid(char)) 
	{
		cout << "The memory address of value " << static_cast<const void*>(ptr) << endl; 
	}
	else
	{
		cout << "The memory address of value " << ptr << endl;
	}
	delete ptr;
}

main(){
	string variable = "Hello";   // you can initialize any data type here
	dynamicMemoryAllocat( variable );
}



QUESTION 4: Implement a C++ function named swapVariables that takes two integer pointers as parameters and performs the following tasks:
1)    Swap the values of the variables pointed to by the given pointers.
2)    Print the values of the variables after the swap.
Use the function in the main program with example variables and print the results.
